# advent-of-code-2021-kotlin

Solutions to a few of the [Advent of Code (AoC) 2021][aoc] puzzles in Kotlin.

Why just "a few"? I'm actually primarily working in [Ruby for my AoC 2021 solutions][aoc-ruby]! However, I was intrigued by a sponsored message that JetBrain was running on the Advent of Code site:

> Get ready to jingle with Advent of Code in Kotlin! Have fun, learn new things, and win prizes. Believe in magic with Kotlin. Happy holidays! https://jb.gg/AoC

That link redirected to a [post on the JetBrains / Kotlin blog][post] inviting developers to try out the Kotlin language via the AoC problems, and providing a nice [Kotlin AoC GitHub template][template] as a starting point. 

I'd never worked with Kotlin before, but [I have used AoC to try out new programming languages before][aoc-typescript]. Serendipitously, I had some time available on the same day in which I came across the ad, and so I decided to give it a go!  

(So, Kotlin team, if you're reading this: The combination of your ad on the AoC site, your blog post, and your GitHub template worked! Nice going! I almost never click on ads!)
